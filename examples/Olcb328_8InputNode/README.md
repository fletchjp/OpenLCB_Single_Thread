# Olcb328_8inputNode Sketch

This sketch demonstrates a very basic input board with eight channels.  

* It implements 8 inputs
* It uses ButtonLED library to implement an input and output on one pin
* It shows how to write a CDI description
* It shows the corresponding EEPROM structure
* It shows how inputs are processed to send eventids

This sketch complements the Olcb328_8outputNode, but is limited in its 
function.  Things like inverting inouts, or adding an option for pullups.
