# This example demonstrates:
- How to use the PicoCan software CAN class, which is based on can2040.
  This use the PIO processors.  
- How to connect a PicoW usign Wifi to connect to an OpenLCB/LCC hub
  You must providelocal network credentials and then it searches for a hub using 
  mDBS.  JMRI has an OpenLCB/LCC hub available.
- Demonstrates using native Servo driver that uses PIO processors.  
  This is limited to 4 while using PicoCan, bu more if using Wifi
